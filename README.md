This Serverless Plugin packages your Rust binaries for deployment through the Serverless Framework to AWS Lambda. I went through about 3 repos and all were out of date or didn't work seemlessly.

Note: this has only been tested on Linux, but I will eventually test it on MacOS after my machine is repaired.
